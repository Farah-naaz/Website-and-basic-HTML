        <h1>Metro rail extends operation for an hour longer amid Ramadan</h1>


         <p>
            The metro rail trains will run for one extra hour starting from tomorrow -- the 16th of Ramadan, MAN Siddique, managing director of Dhaka Mass Transit Company Ltd (DMTCL), said today.

The last train from Motijheel will leave at 9:40pm and the last train from Uttara North at 9:00pm, he told reporters.
Trains from both ends will run every 12 minutes during the last hour of operation.

Ticket counters will close at 8:50pm and only those with MRT and Rapid passes will be able to avail metro service after that time.

Currently, metro rail runs until 8:00pm from the Uttara end and until 8:40pm from Motijheel end.
